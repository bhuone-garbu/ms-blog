# Intro

Bhuwan Garbuja

This repo contains my learning and experiments for event driven microservice design and development.

Concept implementation and learning.

## Tech Stack:

Really simple tech stack and simple code.

* NodeJS/Express
* React
* Docker
* Kubernetes (k8s)

## Concepts:

These concepts are more important and covered in this repo.

* Micro-services design and philosophy (how they should behave and work)
* Designing EventBus for async operations
* Forget monolithic
* Dockerization of services
* K8s deployments

The project attempts to build the following different microserices as proof of concept:

* client (React client for FE)
* posts (ms)
* comments (ms)
* event-bus (ms)
* query (ms)
* moderation (ms)
